# Airgead Banking Investment Calculator

### Overview
The **Airgead Banking Investment Calculator** is a C++ program designed to help users calculate projected returns on their investments over a given number of years. The program provides two types of reports:
1. Investment growth **without monthly deposits**.
2. Investment growth **with monthly deposits**.

This project demonstrates your understanding of object-oriented programming, exception handling, and financial modeling.

## Usage

### Example:
After launching the program, youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the following:
- **Initial Deposit**: The initial investment amount.
- **Monthly Deposit**: The amount deposited each month.
- **Annual Interest Rate**: The interest rate applied annually (in percentage).
- **Number of Years**: The number of years for the investment.

### Sample Input:
```
Initial Deposit: 5000
Monthly Deposit: 200
Annual Interest Rate: 5
